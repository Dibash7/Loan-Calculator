### Downloading the project

There are several ways you can get this project:

#### Cloning The GitHub Repository

The recommended way to get this project is to use git to directly clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/Dibash7/Loan-Calculator.git 
```

This will clone the latest version of the Loan Calculator repository to a folder.

#### Downloading The Repository Zip File

Another way to use the project is to download a zip copy from the master branch on GitHub.

### Quick Install

Once you've downloaded the project and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your Loan Calculator application.

The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```
npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running Your Application

Run your application using terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the development environment configuration, so in your browser just go to http://localhost:3000
